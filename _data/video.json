This session will analyse the pandemic and policy response from a variety of angles. Topics will include the nature and empirical basis for the relevant epidemiological models, the difficulties with exporting policies out of European contexts, and the challenges of democratic citizen science in a context of lay conspiratorial skepticism of science.","link":"https://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/3218409","file":"N/A","service":"","image":"","embed":"<a
